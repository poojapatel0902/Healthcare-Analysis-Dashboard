# Healthcare Analysis Dashboard

## Project Objective
The objective of the US Healthcare Industry Analysis (2020) project is to analyze healthcare financial performance, hospital operations, patient demographics, and provider efficiency using data analytics. This project aims to provide actionable insights into payments, expenses, patient behavior, hospital performance, and provider utilization to support data-driven decision-making in the healthcare sector.

## Project Process
1. Data Collection
Collected healthcare data related to:
-Payments (Insurance & Patient)
-CPT Units
-Hospitals & locations
-Patient demographics & lifestyle
-Provider details & specialties
2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handled missing values and data inconsistencies.
Standardized fields such as date, region, CPT codes, and payment types.
Created calculated measures including:
-Gross expense
-Insurance vs patient payment
-AR ratio, IPPT ratio
-Provider FTE
-CPT unit aggregation
3. Data Modeling
Established relationships between:
Patients, hospitals, providers, CPT codes, and locations.
Created time-based measures for monthly trend analysis.
4. Dashboard Development
Built multiple interactive dashboards:
-Executive Summary
-Hospital Analysis
-Patient Analysis
-Provider Analysis
Added slicers for region, ethnicity, gender, blood group, and specialty.
5. Analysis & Interpretation
Compared month-wise trends.
Identified performance gaps and utilization patterns.

## Project Insights
1. Executive Summary Insights
Gross Expense: 8.42M
Insurance Payments (5M) contribute significantly more than patient payments (1.02M).
CPT Units peaked in the early months (Jan–Mar), followed by a decline mid-year.
Overall payments and CPT activity dropped compared to previous months, indicating operational slowdown during 2020.
2. Hospital Analysis Insights
Total Accounts Receivable (AR): 2.60M across 11 hospitals.
AR and IPPT ratios fluctuate monthly, indicating variations in billing efficiency.
Hospitals account for ~65% of total gross expenses, followed by radiology and surgery.
Midwest and South regions show higher CPT unit contribution, while Northeast is lower.
3. Patient Analysis Insights
Total Patients: 5,117 across 49 states and 531 cities.
Majority of patients follow:
-No diet restrictions (75%)
-No exercise (65%)
High prevalence of non-tobacco users (88%), but alcohol consumption is notable.
Blood Group O+ and A+ are most common.
White and Hispanic populations form the largest patient groups.
Patient distribution is concentrated in major US regions.
4. Provider Analysis Insights
Total Providers: 932
Total Provider FTE: 711.74
34 provider specialties identified.
CPT Units are highest when provider count is high, showing a strong correlation between staffing and productivity.
South and West regions have higher physician counts.
NPP (Non-Physician Providers) and physician specialties contribute equally to service delivery.

## Conclusion
The US Healthcare Industry Analysis (2020) project provides a comprehensive overview of financial performance, hospital efficiency, patient demographics, and provider utilization.
The analysis reveals that insurance payments dominate revenue, hospitals consume the majority of expenses, and provider availability directly impacts service volume.
This dashboard-driven approach enables healthcare stakeholders to improve cost management, patient care strategies, provider allocation, and operational efficiency, making it a powerful decision-support system for the healthcare industry.
Generated insights for financial and operational optimization.
